# Networking and Python Scripting Project

This project includes a set of Bash scripts for making HTTP requests using cURL and a Python script to find peaks in a list of unsorted integers.

## Project Structure

1. **Bash Scripts**
    - `0-body_size.sh`: Retrieves the size of the body of a response from a given URL.
    - `1-body.sh`: Displays the body of the response for a URL with a 200 status code.
    - `2-delete.sh`: Sends a DELETE request to a URL and displays the body of the response.
    - `3-methods.sh`: Displays all HTTP methods the server will accept for a given URL.
    - `4-header.sh`: Sends a GET request with a specific header and displays the body of the response.
    - `5-post_params.sh`: Sends a POST request with specific parameters and displays the body of the response.
    - `100-status_code.sh`: Displays only the status code of the response for a given URL.
    - `101-post_json.sh`: Sends a JSON POST request to a URL and displays the body of the response.
    - `102-catch_me.sh`: Triggers a response from the server.

2. **Python Script**
    - `6-peak.py`: Finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.
    - `6-peak.txt`: Documenting the complexity of the algorithm.
